# Explanation
`Crag_single_data_1` and `crag_single_data_2` are datasets used to fine-tune the base model for solving Task 2.  
Regarding Task 3, we regret to inform you that since we have constructed multiple versions of the dataset, we are unable to determine which datasets correspond to the models that achieved the highest scores. We may organize this information further when we have free time.
